Specific SSI use cases / scope
* legal entity use case to elaborate (company consent, etc)
* both legal entity  and natural person use cases  
* IOT , maybe close to legal entity use cases
* smart contract -> interaction (TT)
* To be defined : 3 to 4 use cases




Decentralized identifiers (DID)
* for natural persons
   * did:key:public_key,
   * new did:ebsi -> did:key:(jwk)
   * anonymization & multi DID
   * 

* for legal entities
   * did:ebsi, did:ala
   * did:web as a starter solution ?
   * ??? public key -> eidas certificates (x509 certificate CA)


* keys
- NIST keys (rsa, p-256, etc)
- “Modern” EC  curves (secp256k1, ed25519 )


- services …




Verifiable credentials/VP 
* Format serialization : JWT
* Atomic credentials or data minimization
* Localization UK
* holder binding ? 


Protocols
* to present verifiable credentials (and user authentication)  
   * SIOPv2


* to exchange verifiable credentials/presentations 
   * OIDC4VP


* to issue credentials
   * OIDC4VCI




Wallet 
* key management -> import/export
* data(VC) management -> import/export 
* No mobile wallet onboarding  
* user binding requirement -> authentication mode to be defined




Verifiable data registries
* revocation VC  or issuer server ?
* trusted issuer/verifier registry (company details)
* accreditation  for registry updates -> gouvernance + paper 




Process  
* legal entity onboarding -> verification status () 
* user onboarding -> “ABF” VC ??
* conformance -> wallet, issuer, verifier




APIs
* for registries 
* vc attribute data on local ipfs node 
* timestamping -> yes
* ledger  implementation on ethereum 






Implementations and libs
* list of available libs
   * https://github.com/decentralized-identity
   * ?


 
Privacy considerations
* minimization of schema/data model
* anonymization of VCs -> correlation, etc
